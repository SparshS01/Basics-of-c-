Aim:
To understand the process of downloading and installing VS Code, and to write and execute two basic C++ programs:

Hello World

Simple Calculator (Addition of Two Numbers)

Algorithm:
(01) HELLO WORLD PROGRAM
Start the program.

Include the necessary header for input/output (#include <iostream>).

Use the using namespace std; statement.

Begin the main() function.

Print "Hello World" to the screen using cout.

End the main() function with return 0;.

End the program.

(02) CALCULATOR PROGRAM (Addition)
Start the program.

Include the necessary header for input/output (#include <iostream>).

Use the using namespace std; statement.

Declare three integer variables: num1, num2, and sum (initialize sum to 0).

Display "Enter first number:" and take input for num1 using cin.

Display "Enter second number:" and take input for num2 using cin.

Calculate the sum of num1 and num2, store it in sum.

Display "Sum of given numbers = " followed by the value of sum using cout.

End the program with return 0;.

Theory:
(01) Hello World Program
The program prints "Hello World" on the screen.

It includes the header file <iostream> to use input/output functions like cin and cout.

The using namespace std; line allows use of standard functions without std:: prefix.

The main() function serves as the entry point of the program.

Inside main(), cout << "Hello World"; displays the message on the screen.

return 0; indicates successful completion of the program.

Note: Ensure correct syntax like cout << instead of cout <.

(02) Calculator Program (Addition)
The program asks the user to enter two numbers.

It takes the inputs using cin and stores them in num1 and num2.

It calculates the sum using sum = num1 + num2;.

The result is displayed using cout.

This demonstrates basic input, output, and arithmetic operations in C++.

Conclusion:
Both programs introduce the basic structure of a C++ program, including:

Use of header files

Input and Output (cin / cout)

Use of variables and arithmetic operations

Program execution flow using main() and return 0;
They serve as the foundation for understanding more complex C++ programs in the future.
